# PlayChannel

PlayChannel is an example of sending model data over a Phoenix Channel in response to changes to that model.  I developed this example in parallel with the blog post [Publishing Model Changes to a Phoenix Channel](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/pushing-model-changes-to-a-phoenix-channel/).

The `GenEvent` support was added in preparation of an upcoming post which I'll link to once it's ready.
