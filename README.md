# PlayChannel

PlayChannel is an example of sending model data over a Phoenix Channel in response to changes to that model.  I developed this example in parallel with the blog post [Publishing Model Changes to a Phoenix Channel](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/pushing-model-changes-to-a-phoenix-channel/).

The `GenEvent` support was added for the blog post [Using GenEvent to Notify a Channel of Updates in Elixir](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/using-genevent-to-notify-a-channel/).
